### Compressor
Compresses files to the LZSS-derived format that the official game expects for Sly level files.

## Instructions
### Extracting assets
1) Download the tools from the Releases panel on the right (or build them)1)
1) If you're extracting PS2 files, move to step 7. For PS3 continue.
1) Download the [psarc](http://www.mediafire.com/file/aegbgpkm3xfot80/psarc.zip/file) tool
1) Go to your installed game's USRDIR directory (example: `C:/rpcs3/dev_hdd0/game/NPUA80663/USRDIR`).
   We'll now refer to this as `$USRDIR`, replace it where appropriate.
1) Copy `psarc.exe` there (or use the full path to it in the next command)
